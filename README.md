**Quick Comment on 4/3 Update:** For some reason, our gui got  messed up. The menubar disappears when add the monster and player panels (for some reason it is part of the JPanel and not the JFrame). Because of this, our  instructions our  in  the file but cannot be accessed during the game as the option to do so it covered. Because of this, we focused on trying to fix it and were not able to add the late pass panel. So as of now, the user can navigate through the level, get caught by the monster, but cannot collect late passes yet.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
